# 🛡️ SQL Injection Lab Journey

This repository documents my hands-on SQL Injection practice using **PortSwigger's Web Security Academy** and **Burp Suite**.

## 🔧 Tools
- Burp Suite Community Edition
- Kali Linux
- Firefox/Burp browser
- Web Security Academy Labs

## 📘 Structure
Each folder inside `/Labs` contains:
- `summary.md`: What the lab teaches
- `steps.md`: Clear steps to solve
- `notes.md`: What I learned
- `screenshots/`: Images of request/response

## 🧪 Labs Solved So Far
- ✅ SQLi in Category Filter
- ⏳ SQLi in Login Bypass
- ⏳ SQLi UNION attack
